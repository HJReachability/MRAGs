\begin{abstract}
Capture-the-flag is a challenging and interesting game that is also a useful proxy for many real-world problems in robotics and other application areas.  The game is adversarial, with multiple, potentially competing, objectives. This interplay between different factors makes the problem complex, even in the case of only two players.  In order for the analysis to be tractable, previous approaches often make some limiting assumptions upon player actions.  In this paper, we present a framework for analyzing and solving a two-player capture-the-flag game as a zero-sum differential game.  Our problem formulation allows each player to make decisions rationally based upon the current player positions, with only an upper bound on the movement speeds.  Using Hamilton-Jacobi reachability analysis, we compute winning regions for each player as subsets of the joint configuration space and derive the corresponding winning strategies.  Simulation results are presented along with implications of the work as a tool for automation-aided decision-making for humans and mixed human-robot teams.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Modern tools in robotics and automation offer great promise for solving a variety of difficult problems.  In application areas ranging from the military~\cite{OFTHEAIRFORCEWASHINGTON:2009p37} to air traffic control~\cite{Erzberger:2006p44} to commercial logistics~\cite{kiva2009}, the use of mobile robots, automation, and automation-aided decision-making for humans offers the potential for revolutionary improvements.  Many of these scenarios will involve robots or complex automation coordinating with human agents and operators, and will require tools that not only generate solutions for difficult automation tasks but also to make those solutions comprehensible and useable to the humans who will be ultimately responsible for the overall system~\cite{Axe:2007p9,Metzger:2001p60}.

The game of capture-the-flag is complex and adversarial, with opposing players and competing objectives that require decisions to be made at multiple levels of play.  It is an excellent proxy for studying the tools needed to make advanced automation systems a reality.  The game is played in many ways, and though there are many rule variations, a simple form of the game with some of the key characteristics will be described here and used for the subsequent analysis.  

Capture-the-flag is a two-sided game played by mobile players constrained to remain within a finite game area divided into two regions allocated to each side.  Each side owns a flag located in their territory that can be captured by an opposing player moving to within some small distance of the flag.  However, while inside the opposing side's territory, a player can be intercepted if an opponent moves within some distance of that player.  The objective of the game is to capture the opponent's flag and return to safety while protecting one's own from the enemy.  Each flag is also typically surrounded by a forbidden region to prevent a defending player from simply staying at the flag location, making flag capture impossible.  

Capture-the-flag in robotics and automation has been explored in a variety of ways, most notably in the Cornell Roboflag competition, where two opposing teams of mobile robots play a game of capture-the-flag while directed by human players~\cite{DAndrea:2003p95}. The competition has produced a number of results dealing with robot control and planning~\cite{Earl:2007p101, Campbell:2003p5, Waydo:2003p97} as well as issues relating to human-robot interaction~\cite{Parasuraman:2005p99}.  

The complexity of adversarial, multi-player games such as capture-the-flag defies easy analysis and solutions.  Many of the previous results focus on the multiple-agent coordination aspect of the game.  A defensive strategy for intercepting multiple attackers with multiple defenders was developed in~\cite{Earl:2007p101} using mixed-integer linear programming, with the assumption that attackers proceed toward the goal in straight lines.  Another approach is proposed in~\cite{Chasparis:2005p102} to solve for optimal defender control actions using linear programming under an assumed attacker strategy in the form of a linear feedback law.  

On a similar note, in practical applications of pursuit-evasion games, the existing methods often generate control strategies for one side while assuming a prediction model for the actions of the opposing side.  One approach uses nonlinear model-predictive control to generate control inputs for an unmanned aerial vehicle in a simulated air combat scenario~\cite{Sprinkle:2004p100}, while another uses approximate dynamic programming for a similar application~\cite{McGrew:2008p103}.  In both cases, adversary actions are predicted based upon expected opponent strategies, with feedback and re-planning used to adjust for deviations from the predicted actions at run-time.  

In this work, we formulate the two-player capture-the-flag problem as a differential game and describe an approach for characterizing the winning regions and winning strategies of each player using Hamilton-Jacobi reachability analysis.  This formulation allows each player to choose their control actions rationally based upon the current positions of the two players, without explicit prediction models.  The application of Hamilton-Jacobi reachability under a differential game setting has found previous successes in aircraft collision avoidance\cite{j:mitchell-TAC-2005}, automated inflight-refueling~\cite{DSST08}, and autonomous quadrotor aerobatics~\cite{GHVT09b}.  In the case of capture-the-flag, this technique allows us to compute the boundaries of the winning regions for both players in the the joint configuration space, as well as derive approximate winning strategies associated with these regions.  This approach not only allows us to examine the game in a flexible and complete manner, but also produces clear and intuitive tools for informing human decision-making~\cite{Oishi:2008p98}, through visualizations of the winning regions and the suggested control actions.  

The structure of this paper is as follows.  We describe our problem formulation and give some geometric insights in Section~\ref{sec:formulation}.  The Hamilton-Jacobi solution is described in Section~\ref{sec:hj_formulation}, with computational and simulation results presented in Section~\ref{sec:results}.  We conclude with discussions and future work in Section~\ref{sec:conc}.

\section{Problem Formulation}
\label{sec:formulation}
The problem considered in this paper is a slightly simplified version of the capture-the-flag game, where the objective of one player, called the attacker, is to capture a flag and return to a safe region, while the objective of the other player, called the defender, is to prevent the attacker from completing this task.  The focus will be on characterizing the set of attaker and defender configurations for which there exists a winning strategy for either player, as well as finding the strategies that ensure the winning conditions.  

\begin{figure}[t]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\columnwidth]{figures/gameDiagram}
	\caption{\textbf{The basic configuration of the capture-the-flag game.}}
	\label{fig:gameDiagram}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Formulation and Definitions}

The playing domain is assumed to be some rectangular set $D \subset \R^2$.  The ``safe'' return region for the attacker is a rectangular strip $R \subset D$, and the flag is located in a circular region $F \subset D$ with radius $r_f$ (see Figure~\ref{fig:gameDiagram}).  

A configuration of the game is described by the vector $(x^a,x^d) \in \mathbb{R}^4$, where $x^a$ and $x^d$ are the planar positions of the attacker and defender, respectively.  As per the rules of the game, the defender is constrained to remain outside of the flag and return regions, while the attacker can move freely through either.  Thus, the set of permissible configurations is given by $\hat{D} = D \times D \setminus (F \cup R) \subset \R^4$.  The equations of motion are given by $\dot{x}^a = u$ and $\dot{x}^d = d$, where $u$ and $d$ are the velocity inputs, constrained by speed limits $V_{a,max}$ and $V_{d,max}$ according to  $|| u ||_2 \leq V_{a,max}$ and $|| d ||_2 \leq V_{d,max}$.  For fairness, we assume that $V_{a,max} = V_{d, max}$.   The attacker is considered to be tagged or intercepted by the defender if the defender comes within distance $r_c$ of the attacker.  This corresponds to a capture region $C = \left\{ (x^a,\ x^d) \in \mathbb{R}^4:  ||x^a - x^d||_2 \leq r_c\right\}$.

Victory for the attacking player is attained by meeting all of the following conditions, assuming the game takes place over some finite time horizon $[0, T_f]$:
\begin{itemize}
\item{Flag capture: $x^a(T_c) \in F$ for some finite time $T_c$ where $0 \leq T_c \leq T_f$ }
\item{Flag return:  $x^a(T_r) \in R$ for some finite time $T_r $ where $T_c \leq T_r \leq T_f$}
\item{Avoiding defender capture: \\
$x^a(t) \in D \bigwedge (x^a(t), x^d(t)) \not \in C$ for all time $t \in [0, T_r] $} 
\end{itemize}
Victory for the defending player is achieved by preventing the attacker from achieving any of the above conditions by $T_f$ while obeying the constraint $x^d \in D \setminus (F \cup R)$.  It should be remarked that when $T_f$ is small, the options of the attacking player may be severely restricted by the time limit.  Correspondingly, this also leads to simplistic delaying strategies by the defending player.  Motivated by this consideration, we will be specifically interested in scenarios where $T_f$ is large, namely as $T_f$ approaches $\infty$.

It is assumed that the positions of both players are fully observable to each other, and that the defender input $d(t)$ may be a function of the attacker input $u(t)$ at each time $t$.  The latter assumption corresponds to a choice in the order of play to prevent an infinite regression of second-guessing between the players.  For the simple dynamics considered here, the opposite order of play leads to an equivalent problem formulation.

The goal of this work is to provide a solution to this two-player game of capture-the-flag in terms of both the winning regions and winning strategies for each player.  For the attacker, we would like to determine a subset of initial configurations $W_A \subset \mathbb{R}^4$ for which there exists a feasible attacker control strategy for achieving the victory conditions, regardless of the control strategy of the defending player.  Furthermore, for any configuration in $W_A$, we would like to determine a winning strategy that ensures the attacker objectives.  Clearly, for any permissible initial configuration outside this set, there exists some defender strategy so as to prevent the attacker from achieving victory, regardless of the attacker strategy.  Thus, the defender winning set $W_D$ is given simply as $\hat{D} \setminus W_A$.  

In building up towards the full winning sets, we will also characterize the partial winning sets for the flag capture and flag return phases of the game.  Some useful terminologies are summarized below.
\begin{itemize}
\item{{\bf Flag Capture Set $F_A$}: configurations from which the attacker can achieve flag capture while avoiding defender interception.}
\item{ {\bf Stop Capture Set $F_D$}: $\hat{D} \setminus F_A$, where the defender can prevent flag capture by the attacker.}
\item{ {\bf Flag Return Set $R_A$}: configurations from which the attacker can achieve flag return while avoiding defender interception.} 
\item{ {\bf Stop Return Set $R_D$}: $\hat{D} \setminus R_A$, where the defender can prevent flag return by the attacker.}
\end{itemize}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Geometric Insights}
\label{sub:geometric}
Before developing the computational analysis, some valuable insight about the winning regions can be gained through geometric constructions.  Although the joint state-space is 4-dimensional, visualizations of the various sets can be created in 2-D by fixing one player's position and examining the set in question in the remaining 2-D space.  These visualizations and the method by which they are created give insights into the strategies for each player at each stage of the game, as well as providing a sanity check against the computational results.  After characterizing these sets, we will demonstrate how they can be used to inform decision-making for a player in the game.  This discussion will provide intuition for the policies synthesized numerically from reachability calculations.

Here we will consider stop capture and stop return sets for the defender in the case of point capture (with $r_c =0$), denoted by $F_D^0$ and $R_D^0$, assuming the initial condition of the attacker is fixed as $x^a_0$.  

%In this section, we will derive analytical characterizations for the winning sets for the defender ($F_D$ and $R_D$) during each individual stage of the game. The union of these sets constitutes an under-approximation of the total winning set $W_D$ and provide insights to the numerical computation of $W_D$ as will be discussed in Sec~\ref{sec:hj_formulation}.
%
%We represent the 4D set $F_D$ as a union of slices $F_D(x^a)$ parameterized by the initial location of the attacker $x^a\in D$, where each slice $F_D(x^a)$, defined by
%\begin{align*}
%F_D(x^a) \triangleq \{x^d\in D^-: (x^a,x^d) \in F_D\},
%\end{align*}
%is a 2D set containing the initial locations starting from which the defender can always stop the attacker from capturing the flag whenever the attacker's initial location is $x^a$. The set $R_D$ is decomposed similarly as $R_D =\cup_{x^a\in D} R_D(x^a)$ with 
%\begin{align*}
%R_D(x^a) \triangleq \{x^d\in D^-: (x^a,x^d) \in R_D\}.
%\end{align*}
%
%To simplify the discussion, we shall mainly focus on an extreme case, where the radius of the capture region is $r_c =0$. In this case, the attacker is tagged only when the two players are at exactly the same location. Denote the stop return and stop flag sets in this extreme case as $R_D^0(x^a)$ and $F_D^0(x^a)$, respectively. The approach can be easily extended to handle the case with $r_c>0$.
%In the rest of this section, unless otherwise stated, we always assume that $r_c=0$. 

\subsubsection{Characterization of $R_D^0(x^a_0)$}
\label{sec:RD0}
Let $o$ and $c_3$ be the two corners of the return region $R$ on the border with the rest of the game region $D$.  Then $R^0_D$ for fixed attacker position $x^a_0$ is simply given by:
\begin{align}
\label{eq:RD0}
R^0_D(x^a_0)= \{x^d : &||x^d - c_3||_2 \leq ||x^a_0 - c_3||_2 \nonumber\\ &\bigwedge 
 ||x^d - o||_2 \leq ||x^a_0 - o||_2 \}
\end{align}
Thus, $R^0_D(x^a_0)$ takes the form of a triangular region with curved sides where the apex is at $x^a_0$.

%Consider the case when the attacker is attempting to arrive at the return region $R$ from some position $x^a_0$, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:RD0}.  It is clear that the attacker will be unable to safely return if it is horizontally aligned by the defender, that is, if the defender is located along the line $c_2c_5$, where $c_2$ is the attacker position and $c_5$ is the point in $R$ closest to $c_2$.  The defender can simply match the attacker's movement in the vertical axis and use any remaining control authority to shorten its distance to the attacker.    
%
%With this consideration in mind, the region of the defender state-space from which the defender can prevent the attacker from arriving in $R$ can be easily characterized.  Let $o$ and $c_3$ be the two corners of the return region $R$ on the border with the rest of the game region $D$.  Then $R_D$ for fixed attacker position $x^a_0$ is simply the region $S$ where
%\begin{eqnarray*}
%S \triangleq \{x_d : ||x_d - c_3||_2 \leq ||x^a_0 - c_3||_2 \bigwedge \\
% ||x_d - o||_2 \leq ||x^a_0 - o||_2 \}
%\end{eqnarray*}
%$R_D$ thus takes the form of a triangular region with curved sides where the apex is at $x^a_0$.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\columnwidth]{figures/RD0}
	\caption{\textbf{Illustration for deriving the stop return set $R_D^0(x^a_0)$}}
	\label{fig:RD0}
\end{figure}

To verify this, consider Figure~\ref{fig:RD0}. The attacker will be blocked from reaching $R$ if it is ever horizontally aligned with the defender with the defender between it and $R$, since the defender can simply parallel the attacker along the vertical axis. Let us denote the defender initial position as $c_6\in S$, and the attacker is located at $c_2$. Consider the case where $c_6$ is above the line $c_5c_2$. The attacker cannot reach the portion of $R$ above $c_6$ without eventually horizontally aligning with the defender and therefore becoming blocked, so it must attempt to reach a point in $R$ below $c_6$.  The defender can prevent this by simply moving toward $o$ at maximum speed.  To avoid being blocked while attempting to reach the portion of $R$ below $c_6$, the attacker must cross the line $c_6o$ at some point $c_7$ before the defender reaches that point.  Since the two players have the same maximum speed, this can happen only if $\|c_2-c_7\|_2\le\|c_6-c_7\|_2$, which is clearly impossible.  A similar argument holds for when $c_6$ is below $c_2c_5$ and the attacker attempts to move upward.

%We first assume that the initial defender location $x^d\in S_1\cap S_2$ and denote its corresponding point in Fig.~\ref{fig:RD0} by $c_6$. Without loss of generality, we assume that $c_6$ is above the line $c_5c_2$. In this case, we propose that the defender travels at its maximum speed towards point $o$ along the line $c_6o$. As mentioned before, the defender wins this part of the game whenever the attacker becomes return-blocked. The only way for the attacker to avoid being blocked is to cross the line $c_6o$ at some point $c_7$ before the defender reaches that point. Since the two players have the same maximum speed, this can happen only if $\|c_2-c_7\|\le\|c_6-c_7\|$, which is clearly impossible. The case when $c_6$ is below the line $c_5c_2$ can be argued similarly by letting the defender travel at the maximum speed towards point $c_3$ along the line $c_6c_3$. Since the defender knows whether it is above or below $c_5c_2$ at any time, it can always win the game if it starts inside $S_1\cap S_2$. 

Now assume that $x^d\notin S$ and $x^d_2>x^a_2$ (above line $c_5c_2$), for example at point $c_8$. In this case, if the attacker moves at its maximum speed along line $c_2o$, then the defender can not capture the attacker as for any point $c_9$ on the line $c_2o$, $\|c_8-c_9\|_2\ge \|c_2-c_9\|_2$. The case where $x^d_2<x^a_2$ can be argued similarly.  Thus the defender can guarantee victory if it begins in $S$, but is guaranteed to lose if it does not.

%According to the above discussion, the set $R_D^0(x^a)$ is indeed given by the intersection of the two sectors $S_1$ and $S_2$, and thus can be immediately computed once $x^a$ is known. 

\subsubsection{Characterization of $F_D^0(x^a_0)$}
\label{sec:FD0}
Now consider the case when the attacker's goal is to enter the flag region $F$.  The winning region of the defender $F_D$ can be found in a similar manner as in the previous case.  Here, the defender can block the attacker when the players are radially aligned with the center of $F$ and the defender is between the attacker and the flag region.  Therefore, it suffices to characterize the set of initial defender locations that can always result in such a blocking situation no matter what the attacker does. 

%We now focus on the first stage of the game where the only goal of the attacker is to get the flag, namely, enter the flag region, while the defender tries to stop the attacker from achieving this goal without considering the second stage of the game at all. The winning zone of the defender for this decoupled part of the game is the stop flag set $F_D^0(x^a)$ (assuming $r_c=0$) and can be characterized in a similar manner as done for the stop return set in the last subsection. 

%The attacker is called {\em flag-blocked} if it is radially aligned with the defender with respect to the circular flag region $F$ and is farther away from $F$ than the defender. Clearly, whenever the attacker is flag-blocked, the defender can always stop it from getting the flag by traveling at the same angular velocity as the attacker and using the remaining control effort to approach the attacker radially. Therefore, it suffices to characterize the set of initial defender locations that can always result in a flag-block situation no matter what the attacker does. 

\begin{figure}[tbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.65\columnwidth]{figures/FD0}
	\caption{\textbf{Illustration for deriving the stop flag set $F_D^0(x^a_0)$}}
	\label{fig:FD0}
\end{figure}

Following the above idea, the derivation of $F_D^0(x^a)$ is illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:FD0}, where $o_f$ is the center of the flag region, $c_o$ is the point corresponding to $x^a_0$, $c_1$ and $c_2$ are the two points for which the two line segments $c_oc_1$ and $c_oc_2$ are tangent to the circular flag region $F$, and $c_5$ is the point where the line segment $c_oo_f$ intersects the $F$. For any point $c_3$ on the circle, denote by $arc(c_3,c_1)$ the circular arc segment between $c_1$ and $c_3$, and by $|arc(c_3,c_1)|$ the length of the arc segment. When $c_3$ is sufficiently close to $c_1$, there always exists another point $c_4$ satisfying
\begin{align*}
\|c_4 - c_3\|_2+|arc(c_3,c_1)| = \|c_1-c_o\|_2. 
\end{align*}
As $c_3$ moves away from $c_1$ clockwise along the circle, the corresponding point $c_4$ changes gradually from $c_o$ to a point on the circle $c_7$. Let $S_3$ be the set enclosed by the curve segment from $c_o$ to $c_7$, the circular segment $arc(c_7,c_5)$ and the line segment $c_5c_o$. Let $S_4$ be the reflection image of $S_3$ with respect to the line $c_oo_f$. A key property of the set $S_3$ is that for any point $c_8$ in the set and any point $c_9$ on the line segment $c_oc_1$, the length of the shortest path, connecting the two points $c_8$ and $c_9$ without passing through the interior of the flag circle, is less than $\|c_9-c_o\|$. According to this property, if the defender starts inside $S_3$ (resp. $S_4$) and travels at the maximum speed along the shortest feasible path\footnote{For example, the shortest feasible path from $c_4$ to $c_1$ is the line segment $c_4c_3$ followed by the circular arc from $c_3$ to $c_1$ as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:FD0}} to $c_1$ (resp. $c_2$), it can always block or intercept the attacker. On the other hand, if the defender's initial position is outside $S_3\cup S_4$ and to the right (resp. left) of the line $c_oo_f$, the attacker can always reach the flag region by traveling at its maximum speed towards $c_1$ (resp. $c_2$) along the line $c_oc_1$ (resp. $c_oc_2$) without being blocked or captured. Therefore, following a similar argument as the one used to justify~(\ref{eq:RD0}), we can conclude that
\begin{align}
F_D^0(x^a) = S_3 \cup S_4. 
\end{align}

\subsubsection{Uses and Limitations}
We now briefly describe how these sets can be used to guide decision making for the defender. 
 
From the previous subsections, the sets $R_D^0(x^a)$ and $F_D^0(x^a)$ can be easily determined once the location of the attacker $x^a$ is given.  At any time $t>0$ during the game, the defender knows the attacker location $x^a(t)$ and whether the attacker has already captured the flag. If the attacker already has the flag, then the defender can check if its location $x^d(t)\in R_D^0(x^a(t))$. If $x^d(t)\in R_D^0(x^a(t))$, then the defender is guaranteed to win the game by following the defensive strategy described in Section~\ref{sec:RD0}. However, if $x^d(t)\notin R_D^0(x^a(t))$, then the defender may lose the game if the attacker plays according to its appropriate strategy. 

On the other hand, if at time $t$ the attacker has not captured the flag, then the defender can check whether its location $x^d(t)\in R_D^0(x^a(t))\cup F_D^0(x^a(t))$. If $x^d(t)\in F_D^0(x^a(t))$, then the defender can stop the attacker from getting the flag by following the defensive strategy described in Section~\ref{sec:FD0}. If $x^d(t)\in R_D^0(x^a(t))\setminus F_D^0(x^a(t))$, then the defender may lose the first stage of the game but is guaranteed to block the return of the attacker by following the defending strategy in Section~\ref{sec:RD0}. In other words, in this case, the defender needs to give up the first stage of the game in order to guarantee the winning of the second stage of the game and in turn the whole game. 

The true complexity of the problem arises from the fact that the two stages of the game cannot be considered in isolation.  Consider the case where the attacker has not captured the flag and $x^d(t)\notin R_D^0(x^a(t))\cup F_D^0(x^a(t))$. Here, the defender cannot prevent flag capture, nor can it prevent flag return from the attacker's current location if the attacker does not attempt to capture the flag. However, the goal of capturing the flag may not be consistent with the goal of achieving a flag return.  This provides the defender an opportunity to win the overall game by positioning itself to prevent flag return while the attacker is attempting flag capture.  During this time the defender may even pursue a mixed strategy that forces the attacker to take a longer route to $F$, giving itself more time to reach $R_D$.  

The appropriate strategies in this case cannot be found by naively considering the two stages independently, yet the interplay between the two stages and the possibility of mixed strategies makes this situation difficult to characterize geometrically.  The addition of any other forbidden regions, such as considering the flag zone during flag return, quickly makes the problem even more complex.  Fortunately, formulating the game as a Hamilton-Jacobi reachability problem provides us with a computational method to explicitly consider such situations.

\section{Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability in Capture-the-Flag}
\label{sec:hj_formulation}
Capture-the-flag falls naturally under the framework of differential games \cite{b:isaacs-1967}, due to the competing objectives of the attacking and defending players.  This allows us to characterize the winning regions of the attacker and defender from the results of Hamilton-Jacobi reachable set calculations \cite{j:mitchell-TAC-2005}, performed using numerical computation tools \cite{j:mitchell-jsc-2008}.  As a further benefit, we can derive from the solutions of these computations the approximate winning control strategies for the respective players.  For details on the theoretical background behind the application of Hamilton-Jacobi equations to problems in optimal control and differential games, the interested reader is referred to \cite{j:Evans-IUMJ-1984,b:bardi-1997}. 

\subsection{Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability}
\label{subsec:hj_background}
Let us refer to the two players in a general differential game as player I and player II.  We assume that the continuous dynamics are modeled by the ordinary differential equation 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:dynamics}
\dot{x} = f(x, u, d), \ x(0) = x_0
\end{equation}
where $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is the system state,  $u$ is the control input of player I, $d$ is the control input of player II, and $x_0$ is the initial condition.  The input ranges of player I and player II will be denoted by $\mathbb{U}$ and $\mathbb{D}$, respectively.  

In terms of control strategies, Player I selects controls $u(t), t \in [0,T]$, satisfying $u(t) \in \mathbb{U}$, possibly as a function of the state $x(t)$.  Similarly, player II selects controls $d(t), t \in [0,T]$, satisfying $d(t) \in \mathbb{D}$.  However, we allow this selection to be a function of both the state $x(t)$
and the control $u(t)$ of player I.  The set of permissible control strategies for players I and II are denoted by $P(T)$ and $\Gamma(T)$, respectively.

Now consider sets $R, A \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ and time horizon $[0, T]$, we are interested in computing the set of initial conditions $x_0 \in \mathbb{R}^n$ for which there exists some choice of player I control policy $\pi(T) \in P(T)$, such that regardless of the choice of player II control strategy $\gamma(t) \in \Gamma(T)$, the state trajectory $x(\cdot)$ under model (\ref{eq:dynamics}) satisfies $x(t) \in R$ for some $t \in [0,T]$ and $x(s) \notin A$, $\forall s \in [0,t]$.  In other words, this is the set of initial conditions that can be controlled into $R$ within finite time by player I, while avoiding $A$ at all times, regardless of the control strategy of player II.  We denote this set by $\mathcal{RA}_T(R,A)$, and refer to it as the \emph{reach-avoid} set over $[0,T]$.

Under suitable conditions, given in~\cite{j:mitchell-TAC-2005} and~\cite{mitchell-thesis}, the reach-avoid set can be obtained from the solution of a constrained Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) partial differential equation (PDE), using level set representation of sets.  Under this representation, a set $G \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is defined implicitly as the sublevel set of a function $\phi_G: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, such that $G = \left\{x\in \mathbb{R}^n, \phi_G (x) \leq 0\right\}$.

Let $\phi: \mathbb{R}^n \times [-T,0] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be the viscosity solution \cite{j:Crandall-TAMS-1983} of the following constrained terminal value HJI PDE,
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:HJ_PDE_reachavoid}
	\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t} + \min \left[0, H\left(x,\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x}\right)\right] = 0,\;\phi(x,0) = \phi_R(x)	 
\end{equation}
subject to 
$$\phi(x,t) \geq -\phi_A(x)$$
where the optimal Hamiltonian is given by
$$H\left(x,p\right) = \min_{u \in \mathbb{U}} \max_{d \in \mathbb{D}} p^T f(x,u,d)$$
and $p = \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x}$ is the gradient of the solution to (\ref{eq:HJ_PDE_reachavoid}), sometimes also referred to as the \emph{co-state}.  The functions $\phi_R, \phi_A$ are the level set representations of $R$ and $A$, respectively.

Then by the argument presented in~\cite{j:mitchell-TAC-2005} and~\cite{mitchell-thesis}, the reach-avoid set is given by 
$$\mathcal{RA}_T(R,A) = \left\{x\in \mathbb{R}^n, \phi (x,-T) \leq 0\right\}$$
The solution to equation (\ref{eq:HJ_PDE_reachavoid}) can be computed using the numerical toolbox described in \cite{j:mitchell-jsc-2008}.

\subsection{Reachability for Capture-the-Flag}
%The capture-the-flag problem can be solved using a sequence of two reach-avoid calculations.  The general idea is as follows.  First we calculate the set of states in the joint state space from which the attacker can reach base $R$ after reaching flag $F$ while avoiding capture and staying inside domain $D$.  This gives us the set of winning configurations for the flag return phase of the game.  The attacker victory set $W_A$ is then the set of initial conditions from which the attacker can reach one of these winning configurations while avoiding capture.  

In this section, we characterize the attacker victory sets $F_A$, $R_A$, and $W_A$ using the reach-avoid operator.  The corresponding defender victory sets $F_D$, $R_D$, and $W_D$ can be obtained via the relations described in Section~\ref{sec:formulation}.  Under the differential game setting, the attacker takes on the role of player I, while defender takes on the role of player II.   

We first consider the flag return phase of the game, taking place over some time horizon $[0,T_r]$.  The goal of the attacker during this phase is to arrive in the return region $R$ within $[0,T_r]$, while avoiding capture by the defender.  The rules require both players to stay within the game region $D$ and the defender to remain outside of $F$ and $R$.  
To maintain the framework of a differential game, we encode the constraints of the defender as part of the winning conditions for the attacker, so that the attacker wins if the defender violates the constraints.  Let $x$ be the joint configuration $(x^a, x^d)$, and $G_A = \left\{x \in \mathbb{R}^4: x^a \in D^C \right\}$, then this translates into the attacker winning condition $O_R \vee O_D$, where
\begin{align*}
&O_R = \left\{\exists t \in [0,T_r], x^a(t) \in R \wedge x(s) \notin C \cup G_A, \forall s \in [0,t]\right\} \\
&O_D = \left\{\exists t \in [0,T_r], x^d(t) \in F \cup R \cup D^C \wedge x(s) \notin C \cup G_A, \right. \\
&\left. \forall s \in [0,t]\right\}
\end{align*}
Define the sets $G_D = \left\{x \in \mathbb{R}^4: x^d \in F \cup R \cup D^C \right\}$ and $G_R = \left\{x \in \mathbb{R}^4: x^a \in R \right\}$.  Then from the above conditions, we can compute the flag return set as
\begin{equation}
R_A = \mathcal{RA}_{T_r}(G_R \cup G_D, C \cup G_A)
\end{equation}

Now consider the flag capture phase of the game, with a time horizon of $[0,T_c]$.  If the second phase of the game is ignored, then the goal of the attacker is to simply arrive in the flag region $F$ within $[0,T_c]$ while avoiding capture by the defender, and the goal of the defender is to capture the attacker or prevent the attacker from reaching $F$.  Using the same constraint encoding as before, the attacker winning condition for this phase is given by
$O_F \vee O_D$, where
\begin{align*}
&O_F = \left\{\exists t \in [0,T_c], x^a(t) \in F \wedge x(s) \notin C \cup G_A, \forall s \in [0,t]\right\} 
\end{align*}
Define the set $G_F = \left\{x \in \mathbb{R}^4: x^a \in F \right\}$.  Then the flag capture set can be computed as
\begin{equation}
F_A = \mathcal{RA}_{T_c}(G_F \cup G_D, C \cup G_A)
\end{equation}

However, when both phases of the game are considered, it is clearly insufficient for the attacker to simply arrive in $F$.  If the defender chooses a strategy such that the attacker arrives at the flag but the overall state $(x^a, x^d)$ is in a configuration outside the flag return set $R_A$, then the defender can prevent the attacker from returning safely to $R$.  In order to ensure flag return, the attacker must reach the set of configurations $\tilde{R}_A = G_F \cap R_A$ during the first phase of the game.  This corresponds to the modified attacker objectives during the flag capture phase $\tilde{O}_F \vee O_D$, where
\begin{align*}
&\tilde{O}_F = \left\{\exists t \in [0,T_c], x(t) \in \tilde{R}_A \wedge x(s) \notin C \cup G_A, \right. \\
&\left. \forall s \in [0,t]\right\}
\end{align*}
From this, we can compute the attacker winning set as
\begin{equation}
W_A = \mathcal{RA}_{T_c}(\tilde{R}_A \cup G_D, C \cup G_A)
\end{equation}

\subsection{Control Strategies}
\label{sub:ctrl_inputs}
With some further assumptions~\cite{j:Lygeros-automatica-1999,j:Tomlin-ProcIEEE-2000}, the solution to~(\ref{eq:HJ_PDE_reachavoid}) also allows us to synthesize winning strategies.  For $x \in \mathcal{RA}_T(R,A)$, the control strategy that allows player I to achieve the desired objectives regardless of the control strategy of player II is described by
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:opt_ctrl_u}
  u^*(x,t) = \arg \min_{u \in \mathbb{U}} \max_{d \in \mathbb{D}} p(x,-t)^T f(x,u,d), \ t \in [0,T] 
\end{equation}
Similarly, for $x \notin \mathcal{RA}_T(R,A)$, the player II control strategy that is guaranteed to prevent player I from achieving the desired objectives is given by
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:opt_ctrl_d}
  d^*(x,t) = \arg \max_{d \in \mathbb{D}} p(x,-t)^T f(x,u^*,d), \ t \in [0,T] 
\end{equation}
The implementation of these control laws depends upon the availability of the co-state $p$.  In some special cases, a closed form expression can be obtained for the co-state, allowing exact implementation of the control laws (\ref{eq:opt_ctrl_u}) and (\ref{eq:opt_ctrl_d}).  When this is not the case, approximate control laws can be obtained by discretizing these control laws, for example at sampling instants $kT, k = 0,1,...$, and computing $p$ via numerical derivatives of $\phi(x,-kT)$.  

For the capture-the-flag problem, the optimal Hamiltonian is given by
$$H\left(x,p\right) = \min_{u \in \mathbb{U}} \max_{d \in \mathbb{D}} p_u^T u + p_d^T d$$
where $p_u = (p_1, p_2)$ and $p_d = (p_3, p_4)$. From this we can deduce the explicit winning strategies
\begin{align}
	\label{eq:opt_ctf_u}
  u^*(x,t) &= -V_{a,max} \frac{p_u(x,-t)}{||p_u(x,-t)||_2} \\
	\label{eq:opt_ctf_d}
  d^*(x,t) &= V_{d,max} \frac{p_d(x,-t)}{||p_d(x,-t)||_2}
\end{align}
Note that for the optimal Hamiltonian in this problem the optimal defender and attacker inputs are independent of each other, thus the choice of player order does not affect the player strategies or the calculation of the winning regions. 

%Intuitively, this corresponds to moving at maximum allowable velocity along the directions indicated by the time-varying directional derivatives $-p_u(x(t),-t) \in \mathbb{R}^2$ or $p_d(x(t),-t) \in \mathbb{R}^2$.

Over short time horizons, time varying strategies can be synthesized for the flag capture and flag return phases of the game as per equations (\ref{eq:opt_ctf_u}) and (\ref{eq:opt_ctf_d}), using $W_A$ and $R_A$, respectively.  Under the attacker control strategy constructed from $W_A$, the trajectory $x = (x^a, x^d)$ is guaranteed to enter $\tilde{R}_A$ within $[0,T_c]$, satisfying the flag capture objective.  At the time instant when $x(t) \in \tilde{R}_A$, the attacker can switch to the control strategy constructed from $R_A$ and safely return to $R$, thus winning the game.

In certain cases where the solution to (\ref{eq:HJ_PDE_reachavoid}) converges, namely $\lim_{t \rightarrow -\infty} \phi(x,t) = \phi_\infty(x)$ for some $\phi_\infty: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, time-invariant control strategies approximating (\ref{eq:opt_ctrl_u}) and (\ref{eq:opt_ctrl_d}) can be constructed.  Specifically, suppose $\phi$ is computed numerically at time steps $-kT_s, k = 0,1,...$, we can select an index $k_0$ at which $||\phi(\cdot, -k_0 T_s) - \phi(\cdot, -(k_0+1)T_s)||_\infty < \epsilon$, for some tolerance $\epsilon > 0$.  If $\epsilon$ is chosen sufficiently small, we can reasonably assume that $\phi(\cdot, -t) \approx \phi(\cdot, -k_0 T_s)$, $\forall t > k_0 T_s$.  This allows us to approximate the long term strategies of the two players by
\begin{align}
	\label{eq:opt_ctrl_inf_u}
  u^*(x) &\approx \arg \min_{u \in \mathbb{U}} \max_{d \in \mathbb{D}} p(x,-k_0 T_s)^T f(x,u,d) \\
  \label{eq:opt_ctrl_inf_d}
  d^*(x) &\approx \arg \max_{d \in \mathbb{D}} p(x,-k_0 T_s)^T f(x,u^*,d) 
\end{align}

For our application, the sets $R_A$ and $W_A$ indeed converges numerically for sufficiently large $T_r$ and $T_c$, leading to approximate long term strategies for the attacker and defender.

The Hamilton-Jacobi reachable sets are calculated using the Level-Set Toolbox~\cite{LSToolbox} developed at the University of British Columbia.  The actual sets lie in the 4-D joint configuration space $(x^a,x^d)$, but for visualization and also to enable intuitive comparisons to the geometric constructions, slices are shown in 2-D with $x^a$ fixed.  The results for $F_D$ and $R_D$ are given in Figure~\ref{fig:compareBothResults}.

For these calculations, the main problem parameters are chosen as $V_{a,max}=V_{d,max}=1$, $r_f = 1$, $r_c = 0.5$, and $T_f = 12$.  It is observed that the sets $F_D$ and $R_D$ become smaller over time as the attacker is given more time to accomplish the desired objectives.  For the particular set of parameters, the sets converge to fixed points after about 6 time units, corresponding to configurations from which the defender can always prevent the attacker from achieving the desired objectives, regardless of the time horizon.  In both cases the computed sets compare well qualitatively to those derived from the geometric analysis, suggesting that the strategies produced by the differential-game are similar to those found analytically.  

The defender winning set $W_D$ is visualized in Figure~\ref{fig:defenderWinSet}, with the attacker fixed at $(2,2)$.  As expected, $W_D$ is much larger than simply $F_D \cup R_D$, reflecting strategies where the defender uses the time during the flag capture phase to arrive at a configuration that blocks the attacker's return path.

Using the reachable sets, simulations are conducted where the attacker and defender chooses controls according to the strategies discussed in Section~\ref{sub:ctrl_inputs}.  Figure~\ref{fig:defenderWin} shows two example scenarios, one for the flag capture phase and the other for the flag return phase.  In both cases, the defender starts within the winning set and successfully intercepts the attacker.  In the scenario shown in Figures~\ref{fig:defenderWin}a and~\ref{fig:defenderWin}b, the attacker attempts to capture the flag by arriving at $F$ tangentially, while the defender intercepts the attacker by taking the shortest path to $F$ and then moving along the perimeter of $F$.  This is identical to the strategy constructed in Section~\ref{sub:geometric} for flag capture, giving us confidence that the reachability calculations are producing reasonable results.  In the scenario shown in Figures~\ref{fig:defenderWin}c and~\ref{fig:defenderWin}d, the attacker attempts to evade the defender by moving towards the lower left corner of $R$, but is intercepted by the defender taking the shortest path to the same location.  This is again predicted by the geometric analysis.

More interesting scenarios involving the interplay between the flag capture and flag return phase are demonstrated in Figure~\ref{fig:combined}.  In Figure~\ref{fig:combined}a, the defender starts within the overall winning set $W_D$, but outside the set $F_D$.  The trajectory simulation in Figure~\ref{fig:combined}b shows that the defender does not try to prevent flag capture, but instead use the time to get into position to prevent flag return and thereby winning the game.  On the other hand, when the defender begins outside $W_D$, as in Figure~\ref{fig:combined}c, the simulated trajectory in Figure~\ref{fig:combined}d shows that the attacker is able to successfully capture the flag and return to the safe region, without being intercepted by the defender at any point.  

The computation time of the reachable sets is strongly tied to the numerical scheme for obtaining the spatial derivatives, as well as the grid size.  With 45 points in each dimension and at high numerical accuracy, each set took approximately 1 hour to compute on an Apple Macbook Pro laptop with a 2.66 Ghz Core i7 processor and 8 GB of RAM.  Sets with 30 points in each dimension can be computed in as little as 4 minutes at lower numerical accuracy.  

It should be noted that some numerical errors are inevitable due to the necessity of solving the Hamilton-Jacobi PDE on a discrete grid.  In particular, the numerical differentiation scheme is poorly equipped to handle sharp set boundaries, corresponding to discontinuities in the spatial derivative.  Due to this reason, it is observed that near the intersection of $F_D$ with $F$, the zero-sublevel set sometimes slightly under-approximates the stop capture set, resulting in defender trajectories that begin just outside of $F_D$ but nevertheless capture the attacker.  More accurate solutions can be obtained with finer spatial discretization, at the cost of higher computational load, which can be especially problematic for the four dimensional example considered here.  To address this numerical issue, a possible approach is to overbound the numerical error by some small $\epsilon > 0$ and either choose the $-\epsilon$ or $+\epsilon$ level set boundaries to ensure winning conditions for the attacker and defender, respectively.

\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{sec:conc}
Hamilton-Jacobi reachability has allowed us to compute winning sets to characterize the two-player capture-the-flag game without making limiting assumptions on the player actions.  Moreover, the reachable sets provide a simple and intuitive visualization tool, and the method used to enforce domain constraints in the reachability computations can be used to account for static obstacles in the game domain.  We are currently implementing software to use reachable sets computed offline to generate online visualization and movement recommendations for a human game of capture-the-flag.  The players will use GPS-equipped smartphones for localization and to display the reachability information, as seen in Figure~\ref{fig:phoneGame}.

In the future, we hope to extend this work to scenarios with partial observability and teams of multiple players.

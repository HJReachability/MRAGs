Path defense outline
** Write the following material and judge whether there is space to write about applying path defense to general target sets

Abstract

I. Introduction
- Refer to intro from previous papers
- Complexity-optimality trade-off

II. Problem formulation
- copy from journal paper and modify

III. Solution 
A. Path defense
- 4D HJI solution description
B. Strong path defense
- Given point p on the path, what is the defender and attacker winning regions
- The best point p* for defender to defend
C. Properties of strongly defendable paths
- A path "behind" a strongly defendable path is strongly defendable

IV. Computational results
- Comparison to 4D HJI solution (winning regions and computation time)
- Non-convex 

V. Conclusion and future work

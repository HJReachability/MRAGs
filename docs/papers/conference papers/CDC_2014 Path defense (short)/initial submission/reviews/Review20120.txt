Comments to the author
======================

In this paper, the authors consider multi-player
reach-avoid games. They present the solution to a
two-player "path defense" game and use this to construct a
(conservative) solution to the more general multi-player
game. This is a very good idea, which shows substantial
computational gains over standard methods. In addition, the
paper is admirably clear and well written.

======================

The paper studies the 1-to-1 reach-avoid game. The major
contribution is the scalability of the proposed approach
and its potential use in a multi-player game. The paper is
well-written. It is very interesting to see how the
game-theoretical approach is compared to other motion
planning methods. Overall, it is a valid conference paper.

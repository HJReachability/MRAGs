\section{Conclusions and Future Work} \label{sec:conc}
We have presented an efficient method, based on the idea of path defense, for approximating 2D slices of 4D reach-avoid sets in the two player reach-avoid game. By leveraging the properties of shortest paths between points on the domain boundary, we were able to compute these slices using a series of 2D distance calculations, which can be done very quickly using FMM. Our method is conservative towards the defender, but two to three orders of magnitude faster than the previous HJI reachability method \cite{Chen2014}.

By using maximum matching tie together two-player game solutions, we were also able to approximate the solution to the multiplayer reach-avoid game without significant additional computation overhead. A maximum matching algorithm determines the defender-attacker pairing that prevents the maximum number of attackers from reaching the target. This way, we were able to guarantee an upper bound on the number of attackers that are able to get to the target without directly solving the corresponding high dimensional, numerically intractable HJI PDE. 

%An immediate extension of this work is to investigate defender strategies that optimally promote an increase in maximum matching size. Many other extensions of this work naturally arise, including analyzing reach-avoid games with unfair teams with different numbers of players on each team, more complex player dynamics, or partial observability.

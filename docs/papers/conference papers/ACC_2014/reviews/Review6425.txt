Comments to the author
======================

The paper is a good application of matching techniques of
bipartite
graphs to reach-avoid games. A scalable solution is
proposed and
demonstrated on some examples.

If I understand, a maximum matching size denotes how many
defenders succeeded in preventing attackers from reaching
the target. The symbol m is better used for this purpose.
(m is the size of a matching in typical matching
literature, I
support this usage.)
But here m is used in the converse sense.

The authors could give some more explanation about special
cases.
When would there not be a perfect matching? for too small a
defender radius?
What happens when there are no obstacles?

These extreme cases would be easier to understand.
The only extreme case the authors write is when there is
just
one defender and one attacker. And then, the full
generality problem!
Some intermediate situations will be helpful too.

I don't think I found to what extent the approximated
solution
is close to the actual solution. For the examples
considered, an optimal
solution can be calculated by brute force and used for
comparison, I suggest.

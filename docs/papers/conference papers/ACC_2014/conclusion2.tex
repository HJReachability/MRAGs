\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conc}
By solving a single 4D HJI PDE representing the two-player reach-avoid game, we obtained the winners in all attacker-defender pairs. Then, a maximum matching algorithm determines the pairing that prevents the maximum number of attackers from reaching the target.  Calculating time-varying defender-attacker pairings allows the defending team to potentially increase the size of the maximum matching over time.

\begin{abstract}
We consider a multiplayer reach-avoid game with an equal number of attackers and defenders moving with simple dynamics on a two-dimensional domain possibly with obstacles. The attacking team attempts to win the game by sending at least $\m$ attackers to a certain target location quickly while the defenders aim to capture the attackers to prevent the attacking team from reaching its goal.  The analysis of problems like this plays an important role in collision avoidance, motion planning, and aircraft control, among other applications. Computing optimal solutions for such multiplayer games is intractable due to the curse of dimensionality. This paper provides a first attempt to address such computational intractability by combining maximum matching in graph theory with the classical Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs approach. In addition, our solution provides an initial step to take cooperation into account by computing maximum matching in real time.

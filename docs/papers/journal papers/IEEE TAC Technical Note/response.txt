In the previous revision, we have satisfactorily addressed many of the reviewers' concerns We address the remaining concerns in this revision. More specifically, the following changes were made:

1)
The techniques presented in this paper is applicable to multiplayer reach-avoid game in which the two teams do not have equal numbers of players. We revised the problem formulation to define the multiplayer game as a game between NA attackers and ND defenders. This new problem formulation is more general and better reflects the flexibility of our work.

2)
We added Sections V-E and VI-C to better emphasize that our techinques provide a joint cooperative control strategy for the defending team to guarantee successful defense against at least m attackers. At a high level, the cooperative strategy is obtained from a combination of defenders' knowledge of teammates' control strategies, guaranteed pairwise outcomes, and optimal attacker-defender pairing. To our knowledge, no other method can synthesize a controller that can provide a similar guarantee in the multiplayer game.

... my opinion is that the method provided for reach-avoid games is not
general enough to justify publication in TAC.

The main reason I say this is related to Concerns 2 & 4. 

In particular, the method proposed in this paper is based upon a
maximum matching process (where a defender is matched with an
attacker). I agree with the authors that a maximum matching can still
be found when the number of attackers is larger. I also presume that an
upper bound can be found in the number of attackers that enter the
defense zone. However, given that the method is based on one-to-one
matchings, the method ignores completely the potential of a
collaborative action between the defenders (some sort of higher-level
strategies). I understand that the problem in general is quite hard,
but the introduced notion of one-to-one matchings is an
oversimplification of the problem that completely removes the element
of a "team".

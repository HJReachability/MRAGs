Version 2:
This is a resubmission of the paper that was originally a full paper which was then converted into a technical note.

Version 3:
This is a resubmission of the previous version which used the
"technote" document class in the IEEEtran template. As requested, the
new (current) submission uses the "journal" document class in the
IEEEtran template.

Note that this is still meant to be submitted as a technical note.

\begin{abstract}
A multiplayer reach-avoid game is a differential game between an attacking team with $\NA$ attackers and a defending team with $\ND$ defenders playing on a compact domain with obstacles. The attacking team aims to send $\m$ of the $\NA$ attackers to some target location, while the defending team aims to prevent that by capturing attackers or indefinitely delaying attackers from reaching the target. The analysis of this game plays an important role in many applications. The optimal solution to this game is computationally intractable when $\NA>1$ or $\ND>1$. In this paper, we present two approaches for the $\NA=\ND=1$ case to determine pairwise outcomes, and a graph theoretic maximum matching approach to merge these pairwise outcomes for an $\NA,\ND>1$ solution that provides guarantees on the performance of the defending team. We will show that the four-dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs approach allows for real-time updates to the maximum matching, and that the two-dimensional ``path defense" approach is considerably more scalable with the number of players while maintaining defender performance guarantees.

% A multiplayer reach-avoid game is a differential game between an attacking team with NA attackers and a defending team with ND defenders playing on a compact domain with obstacles. The attacking team aims to send M of the NA attackers to some target location, while the defending team aims to prevent that by capturing attackers or indefinitely delaying attackers from reaching the target. The analysis of this game plays an important role in many applications. The optimal solution to this game is computationally intractable when NA>1 or ND>1. In this paper, we present two approaches for the NA=ND=1 case to determine pairwise outcomes, and a graph theoretic maximum matching approach to merge these pairwise outcomes for an NA,ND>1 solution that provides guarantees on the performance of the defending team. We will show that the four-dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs approach allows for real-time updates to the maximum matching, and that the two-dimensional "path defense" approach is considerably more scalable with the number of players while maintaining defender performance guarantees.

%% THEORY
\input{"solution PD game.tex"}
% Path defense game as special case of general 2-player reach-avoid
% Alternate way of solving path defense game through strong defense
	% lemma 1: winning regions for defender once defender is on the path
	% lemma 2: optimal point on the path for defender to go to
% Conservatism of strong path defense (insight beyond HJI)

\input{"solution PD reach-avoid.tex"} 
% Properties of strong path defense
	% Rotating paths backwards
% 2 player reach-avoid using path defense
	% Convex (solved)
	% Simply connected (strong path defense method)
		% only need to check paths touching target
	% Obstacles (strong path defense method)
		% only checking paths touching target may be even more conservative
% Conservatism of reach-avoid via strong path defense (defender winning regions)
	% Compare to 4D HJI solution

%%%%% MULTIPLAYER GAME
% Assume we have the solution to the two-player game
% Maximum matching ties together two-player game solutions
\input{two_to_multi.tex}

%% IMPLEMENTATION (Put algorithms in the previous sections)
% Finding the shortest path touching the target
% Choosing a path to defend
% Computing attacker winning regions given point
% Determining optimal point on a path to defend
% Conservatism (binary search on paths)

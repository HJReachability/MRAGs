\section{The Path Defense Solution to the Two-Player Game}
\label{sec:path_defense}
Solving a 4D HJI PDE involves discretizing a 4D space, and is thus time- and memory-intensive. Instead of computing the entire 4D reach-avoid set given by the HJI solution, we will approximate 2D slices of the reach-avoid set (or simply ``2D slices") in the path defense approach. These slices will be the 4D reach-avoid set sliced at desired attacker positions.

In this section, we first introduce the \textit{Path Defense Game} as presented, a specific type of reach-avoid game, and then describe an efficient way to approximately compute the defender's winning region in this specific game. Next, we will use the solution to the path defense game as a building block for approximating 2D slices of the general two-player reach-avoid game. For the path defense approach, we will assume that the defender is not slower than the attacker: $\vela \leq \velb$. 

%This material was presented in \cite{} without considering the defender capture radius, which we incorporate in this paper.

\subsection{The Path Defense Game}
\label{subsec:pd_game}
The \textit{Path Defense Game} is a two-player reach-avoid game in which the boundary of the target set is the shortest path between two points on $\boundary$, and the target set is on one side of that shortest path. We denote the target set as $\target=\sac$ for two given points on the boundary $\apa,\apb$. $\sa$ and $\pathd$ are defined below. 

% Definitions
\begin{defn} % Shortest path between two points
\textbf{Path of defense}. Denote the shortest path between two points $\x,\y$ to be $\path(\x,\y)$. The length of $\path(\x,\y)$ is denoted $\dist(\x,\y)$, and the time it takes for the attacker and defender to traverse $\path(\x,\y)$ is denoted $\ta(\x, \y),\tb(\x,\y)$, respectively. Note the distinction between $\dist(\cdot,\cdot)$, which denotes distance, and $\cb(\cdot)$, which denotes control function of the defender.

A path of defense, $\pathd$, is the shortest path between points $\apa$ and $\apb$ located on $\boundary$. $\apa$ and $\apb$ are referred to as the \textbf{anchor points} of path $\pathd$. 
\end{defn}

For convenience, we will also use $\dist(\cdot,\cdot)$ with one or both arguments being sets. In this case, $\dist(\cdot,\cdot)$ will denote the shortest distance between the objects in the two arguments.

\begin{defn} % Attacker's side of the path (needed?)
\textbf{Attacker's side of the path}. A path of defense $\pathd$ partitions the domain $\amb$ into two regions. Define $\sa$ to be the region that contains the attacker, not including points on the path $\pathd$. The attacker seeks to reach the target set $\target=\sac$.
\end{defn}

The basic setup of the path defense game is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:pd_form}.

\subsection{Solving The Path Defense Game}
A path defense game can be directly solved by computing a 4D reach-avoid set as described in Section \ref{sec:solution_hji} with $\target=\sac$, which, as noted earlier, can be time- and memory- intensive. Hence, we propose an efficient way to approximate a 2D slice that is conservative towards the defender. We start with some definitions.

% Definitions
\begin{defn} % Defendable path
\textbf{Defendable path}. Given initial conditions $\xjn=(\xan,\xbn)$, a path $\pathd$ is defendable if regardless of the attacker's actions, the defender has a control function $\cb(\cdot)$ to prevent the attacker from reaching $\pathd$ without being captured.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn} % Strongly defendable path
\textbf{Strongly defendable path}. Given initial conditions $\xjn=(\xan,\xbn)$, a path $\pathd$ is strongly defendable if regardless of the attacker's actions, the defender has a control function $\cb(\cdot)$ to reach $\pathd$ after finite time and prevent the attacker from reaching $\pathd$ without being captured. Note that the defender is not explicitly required to stay on $\pathd$ after reaching it.
\end{defn}

\begin{rem}
A path $\pathd$ is defendable if it is strongly defendable.
\end{rem}

Checking whether a path $\pathd$ is defendable is exactly the path defense problem. Since solving the path defense problem involves a 4D reach-avoid set calculation, we instead consider the problem of checking whether a path $\pathd$ is strongly defendable. The following definitions lead to our first Lemma which describes how to determine strong defendability using 2D distance calculations; the definitions and Lemma are illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:lemma1}.

\begin{defn} % Level set image of attacker
\textbf{Level set image of attacker}. Given attacker position $\xa(t)$, define the level set image of the attacker with respect to anchor point $\apa$ to be $\xai(t;\apa) = \{\x\in\pathd: \ta(\x,\apa) = \ta(\xa(t),\apa)\}$. $\xai$ is the unique point on $\pathd$ that has the same distance to $\apa$ as $\xa$. Define $\xai(t;\apb)$ similarly by replacing $\apa$ with $\apb$. For convenience, we will sometimes omit the time argument and write $\xai(\apa)$.
\end{defn}

\begin{rem}
\label{rem:image_of_a}
$\dist(\xai(\apb),\apa) \le \dist(\xai(\apa),\apa)$. 

\textit{Proof}:
First note that
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
\dist(\apa,\apb) &\le \dist(\xa,\apa) + \dist(\xa,\apb)\\
& \text{(Definition of shortest path between $\apa$ and $\apb$)} \\
& = \dist(\xai(\apa),\apa) + \dist(\xai(\apb),\apb) \\
& \text{(Definition of level set image)}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}

Then, since the left hand side is given by $\dist(\apa,\apb) = \dist(\apa,\xai(\apb))+\dist(\xai(\apb),\apb)$, the result follows.
\end{rem}

\begin{defn} % Defender capture set
\textbf{Capture set}: Define the capture set to be $\Dc(\y,t)=\{\x \mid \dist(\x,\y(t))\leq \Rc\}$. Note that $\y(t)$ is in general a time-dependent position, and this set moves with $\y(t)$ as a function of time; however, for convenience, we will drop the second argument of $\Dc$ when $\y$ does not depend on time.
\end{defn}

\begin{rem}
Given some path of defense $\pathd$, suppose the level set image of the attacker is within defender's capture set at some time $s$: 

\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
&\xai(s;\apa) \in \Dc(\xb, s) \\
\text{(or } & \xai(s;\apb) \in \Dc(\xb, s) \text{)}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
Then, there exists a control to keep the level set image of the attacker within capture radius of the defender thereafter: 

\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
&\xai(t;\apa) \in \Dc(\xb, t) \forall t\geq s\\
\text{(or } & \xai(t;\apb) \in \Dc(\xb, t) \forall t\geq s\text{)}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}

This is because the attacker's image can move at most as fast as the attacker, whose speed is at most the defender's speed by assumption.
\end{rem}

\begin{defn} % Winning regions for defender given path and point
\label{def:d_win_region}
\textbf{Regions induced by point $\ppath$ on path}. Given a point $\ppath\in\pathd$, define a region $\rpa\left(\ppath\right)$ associated the point $\ppath$ and anchor point $\apa$ as follows:
\bq
\rpa\left(\ppath\right) = \left\{\x: \dist(\x,\apa) \leq \dist(\Dc(\ppath),\apa) \right\}
\eq

Define $\rpb(\ppath)$ similarly by replacing $\apa$ with $\apb$.
\end{defn}

% Lemma involving winning regions for defender
Now we are ready for our first Lemma, which gives sufficient conditions for strong path defense.
\begin{lem}
\label{lem:d_winning_region}
Suppose that the defender is on some point $\ppath$ on the path $\pathd$, i.e. $\xbn = \ppath$. Furthermore, assume that $\vela=\velb$. Then, $\pathd$ is strongly defendable if and only if the attacker's initial position $\xan$ is outside the region induced by $\ppath$: $\xan\in\amb\backslash\left(\rpa \cup \rpb\right)$.
\end{lem}

\begin{IEEEproof} % This assumes speed of attacker is same as (or less than) speed of defender 
The proof is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:lemma1}. We assume $\xan \notin \target = \sac$, otherwise the attacker would start inside the target set. 

First, we show that if $\xan\in \rpa \cup \rpb$, then the attacker can reach $\apa$ or $\apb$ and hence $\sac$ without being captured. 

Without loss of generality, suppose $\xan\in\rpa$. To capture the attacker, the defender's capture set must necessarily contain $\xai(\apa)$ or $\xai(\apb)$ at some time $t$. By definition \ref{def:d_win_region}, we have $\dist(\xan,\apa) < \dist(\Dc(\ppath),\apa)$, so $\ta(\xai(\apa),\apa) < \tb(\Dc(\ppath),\apa)$. By remark \ref{rem:image_of_a}, we also have $\dist(\xai(\apb),\apa) \le \dist(\xai(\apa),\apa)$, so it suffices to show that the defender's capture set never reaches $\xai(\apa)$ before the attacker reaches $\apa$. 

If the attacker moves towards $\apa$ along $\path(\xan,\apa)$ with maximum speed, then $\xai(\apa)$ will move towards $\apa$ along $\path(\xai(\apa),\apa)$ at the same speed. Since $\ta(\xa,\apa)=\ta(\xai(\apa),\apa)<\tb(\Dc(\ppath),\apa)$, $\xai(\apa)$ will reach $\apa$ before the defender capture set $\Dc(\xb,t)$ does. When $\xai(\apa)=\apa$, we also have $\xa=\apa\in\sac$. Thus, the defender never captures the attacker's level set image. Therefore, no matter what the defender does, the attacker can reach $\sac$ by moving towards $\apa$ at maximum speed along $\path(\xan,\apa)$.

Next, we show, by contradiction, that if $\xa\notin\rpa \cup \rpb$, then the attacker cannot reach $\sac$ without being captured. 

Suppose $\pa$ will reach some point $\pprime$ before $\Dc(\pb,t)$ does, i.e. $\dist(\xan,\pprime)<\dist(\Dc(\xbn),\pprime)=\dist(\Dc(\ppath),\pprime)$. Without loss of generality, assume $\pprime\in\path(\ppath,\apb)$, and note that $\dist(\Dc(\ppath),\apb)<\dist(\xan,\apb)$ since the attacker is not in $\rpb$. Starting with the definition of the shortest path, we have
\bq
\begin{aligned}
\dist(\xan,\apb) &\le \dist(\xan,\pprime) + \dist(\pprime,\apb) \\
& \text{(definition of shortest path / triangle inequality)} \\
&< \dist(\Dc(\ppath),\pprime) + \dist(\pprime,\apb) \\
& \text{(by assumption, $\dist(\xan,\pprime)<\dist(\Dc(\ppath),\pprime)$)}\\ 
&= \dist(\Dc(\ppath),\apb) \\
\dist(\xan,\apb)&< \dist(\xan, \apb) \\
& \text{(since $\xan\notin\rpa$)}
\end{aligned}
\eq

This is a contradiction. Therefore, the attacker cannot cross any point $\pprime$ on $\pathd$ without being captured. This proves Lemma \ref{lem:d_winning_region}. 
\end{IEEEproof}

\label{fig:lemma1}
\end{figure}

Given $\xbn=\ppath\in\pathd$, Lemma \ref{lem:d_winning_region} partitions $\sa$ into two regions, assuming $\vela=\velb$: if the attacker is initially in $\rpa \cup \rpb$, then $\pathd$ is not strongly defendable; otherwise, it is strongly defendable. In the case that $\vela<\velb$, the attacker being outside of $\rpa \cup \rpb$ becomes a sufficient condition (not necessary) for the strong defendability of $\pathd$.

In general, $\xbn$ may not be on $\pathd$. In this case, to strongly defend $\pathd$, the defender needs to first arrive at some point $\ppath\in\pathd$. If the defender can arrive at $\ppath$ before the attacker moves into $\rpa(\ppath)\cup\rpb(\ppath)$, then $\ppath$ is strongly defendable. 

Thus, given $\xjn = (\xan,\xbn)$, we may naively check whether a path $\pathd$ is strongly defendable as follows:

For all points on the path $\ppath\in\pathd$,
\begin{enumerate}
\item Compute $\tb(\xbn, \ppath)$.
\item Compute $\ta\left(\xan,\rpa(\ppath)\cup\rpb(\ppath)\right)$.
\end{enumerate}
If there exists some $\ppath\in\pathd$ such that $\tb(\xbn, \ppath)\le\ta\left(\xan,\rpa(\ppath)\cup\rpb(\ppath)\right)$, then $\pathd$ is strongly defendable. 

The above procedure requires two distance computations for \textit{every} point on the path $\pathd$. The next lemma shows that it is necessary and sufficient to perform the computations for only \textit{one} special point denoted $\pstar$. Before presenting the lemma, we first make a remark.

\begin{rem} \label{rem:time_to_region_a}
Given $\ppath\in\pathd$, $\dist\left(\xan,\rpa(\ppath)\right) = \dist(\xan,\apa) - \dist(\Dc(\ppath),\apa)$. Similarly, $\dist\left(\xan,\rpb(\ppath)\right) = \dist(\xan,\apb) - \dist(\Dc(\ppath),\apb)$.
\end{rem}

\begin{lem} \label{lem:pstar}
Let a point $\pstar$ on the path $\pathd$ be such that $\ta(\xan,\rpa)=\ta(\xan,\rpb)$. Then, $\pathd$ is strongly defendable if and only if the defender can defend $\pathd$ by first going to $\pstar$.
\end{lem}

\begin{IEEEproof}
One direction is clear: if the defender can defend $\pathd$ by first going to $\pstar$, then $\pathd$ is strongly defendable by definition.

We will show the other direction by showing its contrapositive: if the defender cannot defend $\pathd$ by first going to $\pstar$, then $\pathd$ is not strongly defendable. Equivalently, we will show that if choosing $\pstar$ as the first point of entry does not allow the defender to defend $\pathd$, then no other choice of $\ppath$ as the first point of entry does.

Suppose that the defender cannot defend $\pathd$ by choosing $\pstar$ as the first point of entry, but can defend $\pathd$ by choosing another point $\pprime$ as the first point of entry. Without loss of generality, assume $\dist(\Dc(\pstar),\apa)-\dist(\Dc(\pprime),\apa)>0$. This assumption moves $\pprime$ further away from $\apa$ than $\pstar$, causing $\rpa$ to move closer to $\xan$. Starting with Remark \ref{rem:time_to_region_a}, we have

\bq
\begin{aligned}
\dist\left(\xan,\rpa(\pstar)\right) & = \dist(\xan,\apa) - \dist(\Dc(\pstar),\apa) \\
\ta\left(\xan,\rpa(\pstar)\right) & = \ta(\xan,\apa) - \ta(\Dc(\pstar),\apa) 
\end{aligned}
\eq

Similarly, for the point $\pprime$, we have
\bq
\begin{aligned}
\dist\left(\xan,\rpa(\pprime)\right) & = \dist(\xan,\apa) - \dist(\Dc(\pprime),\apa) \\
\ta\left(\xan,\rpa(\pprime)\right) & = \ta(\xan,\apa) - \ta(\Dc(\pprime),\apa) 
\end{aligned}
\eq

Then, subtracting the above two equations, we derive that the attacker will be able to get to $\rpa$ sooner by the following amount of time:
\bq
\begin{aligned}
\ta\left(\xan,\rpa(\pstar)\right) - \ta\left(\xan,\rpa(\pprime)\right) &= \ta(\Dc(\pprime),\apa) - \ta(\Dc(\pstar),\apa) \\
&= \ta(\pprime,\pstar) \\
& \ge \tb(\pprime,\pstar)
\end{aligned}
\eq

We now show that the defender can get to $\pprime$ sooner than to $\pstar$ by less than the amount $\tb(\pprime,\pstar)$, and therefore the defender in effect ``gains less time" than the attacker does by going to $\pprime$. We assume that $\pprime$ is closer to the defender than $\pstar$ is (otherwise the defend would actually ``lose time" by going to $\pprime$, which trivially implies the the path cannot be strongly defended). Then, by the triangle inequality, we have

\bq
\begin{aligned}
\dist(\xbn,\pstar) & \leq \dist(\xbn,\pprime) + \dist(\pprime,\pstar) \\
\dist(\xbn,\pstar) - \dist(\xbn,\pprime) & \leq  \dist(\pprime,\pstar) \\
\tb(\xbn,\pstar) - \tb(\xbn,\pprime) & \leq  \tb(\pprime,\pstar)
\end{aligned}
\eq
This completes the proof.
\end{IEEEproof}

Lemmas \ref{lem:d_winning_region} and \ref{lem:pstar} give a simple algorithm to compute, given $\xan$, the region that the defender must be in for a path of defense $\pathd$ to be strongly defendable:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Given $\apa, \apb,\xan$, compute $\pstar$ and $\rpa(\pstar),\rpb(\pstar)$.
\item If $\vela=\velb$, then $\pathd$ is strongly defendable if and only if $\xbn\in\dr(\apa,\apb;\xan)=\{x:\tb(\x,\pstar) \le \ta(\xan,\rpa \cup \rpb)\}$. If $\vela\le\velb$, then $\xbn\in\dr(\apa,\apb;\xan)$ becomes a sufficient condition for $\pathd$ being strongly defendable.
\end{enumerate}

The computations in this algorithm can be efficiently computed by using FMM \cite{Sethian1996} on a 2D grid. Thus, we have conservatively solved the path defense problem, orginally a 4D problem, by solving a series of 2D Eikonal equations. 

Figure \ref{fig:lemma2} illustrates the proof of Lemma \ref{lem:pstar} and the defender winning region $\dr$.

% \subsection{Conservatism of strong path defense \label{subsec:pd_cons}}
% To quantify how conservative strong path defense is, we consider the following question: what paths of defense are defendable, but not strongly defendable? One example of such a path is the Voronoi line between an attacker and a defender with equal speeds in a convex domain. This is shown in figure \ref{fig:voronoi_pod}.

% \begin{figure}[h]
% \centering

% \begin{subfigure}{0.45\textwidth}
% \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{"fig/defend voronoi"}
% \caption{The defender can defend the initial Voronoi line by mirroring the attacker's movement.}
% \label{subfig:vor_pod1}
% \end{subfigure}

% \begin{subfigure}{0.45\textwidth}
% \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{"fig/voronoi strong defense"}
% \caption{If the defender tries to arrive at some point $\ppath$, and then strongly defend it, then the attacker will arrive at one of the anchor points before the defender.}
% \label{subfig:vor_pod2}
% \end{subfigure}

% \caption{The Voronoi line is a path of defense that is defendable but not strongly defendable.}
% \label{fig:voronoi_pod}
% \end{figure}

% To quantify the conservatism of strong path defense compared to path defense, we compute the defendable region and the strongly defendable region, defined below.

% First, observe that if a path is strongly defendable, any path ``behind" it on the defender's side is also strongly defendable. This is illustrated in figure \ref{fig:path_behind}. Suppose $\pathds{i}$ is strongly defendable, then it is defendable. This necessarily implies that $\pathds{j}$ is defendable, because if the defender defends $\pathds{i}$, then the attacker can never cross $\pathds{i}$ and thus never cross $\pathds{j}$. Since $\pathds{i}$ is strongly defendable, the defender can move to some point on $\pathds{i}$, and then defend $\pathds{i}$. However, on the way to $\pathds{i}$, the defender would have crossed $\pathds{j}$. Now, we have that the defender arrives at some point on $\pathds{j}$ and can defend it afterwards; therefore $\pathds{j}$ is strongly defendable.

% \begin{figure}[h]
% \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{"fig/path behind"}
% \caption{$\pathds{i}$ is strongly defendable if $\pathds{j}$ is strongly defendable.}
% \label{fig:path_behind}
% \end{figure}

% \begin{defn}
% Given joint initial condition $\xn$ and a (strongly) defendable path $\pathd$, call the region $\sac$ the \textbf{(strongly) defendable region given $\pathd$}. Define the union of all (strongly) defendable regions given paths to be the \textbf{(strongly) defendable region}, denoted ($\sdr$) $\dr$:
% \bq
% \begin{aligned}
% \dr &= \bigcup_{\pathd \text{ defendable}} \sac\\
% \sdr &= \bigcup_{\pathd \text{ strongly defendable}} \sac
% \end{aligned}
% \eq
% \end{defn}

% For a given joint initial condition $\xn$, we express the conservatism of strong path defense as the ratio $\text{area}(\dr) / \text{area}(\sdr)$.
